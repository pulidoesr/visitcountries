1. CCA2 (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
CCA2 refers to the 2-letter country code defined by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.
It is widely used in various international contexts, including internet domain suffixes, such as .us for the United States, .uk for the United Kingdom, and so on.

2. CCN3 (ISO 3166-1 numeric-3)
CCN3 refers to the 3-digit numeric country code defined by the ISO 3166-1 numeric-3 standard.
This is a numeric system that provides another layer of international standardization, used particularly in contexts where language might be an issue or where numbers are easier to process.

3. CCA3 (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3)
CCA3 refers to the 3-letter country code defined by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 standard.
It provides a more intuitive way to identify countries using three letters, making the codes slightly more descriptive than the 2-letter CCA2 code.

4. CIOC (International Olympic Committee code)
CIOC refers to the country codes used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
These are used in the context of international sports competitions, especially the Olympics, to identify countries.
While similar to CCA3, there are slight differences for some countries due to historical reasons or country-specific naming.
